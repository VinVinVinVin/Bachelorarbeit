@article{Kinnaird.2009,
 abstract = {A previous study from our laboratory showed that when soleus electromyography was used to control the amount of plantar flexion assistance from a robotic ankle exoskeleton, subjects significantly reduced their soleus activity to quickly return to normal gait kinematics. We speculated that subjects were primarily responding to the local mechanical assistance of the exoskeleton rather than directly attempting to reduce exoskeleton mechanical power via decreases in soleus activity. To test this observation we studied ten healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s while wearing a robotic exoskeleton proportionally controlled by medial gastrocnemius activation. We hypothesized that subjects would primarily decrease soleus activity due to its synergistic mechanics with the exoskeleton. Subjects decreased medial gastrocnemius recruitment by 12{\%} ( p {\textless} 0.05 ) but decreased soleus recruitment by 27{\%} ( p {\textless} 0.05). In agreement with our hypothesis, the primary reduction in muscle activity was not for the control muscle (medial gastrocnemius) but for the anatomical synergist to the exoskeleton (soleus). These findings indicate that anatomical morphology needs to be considered carefully when designing software and hardware for robotic exoskeletons.},

@article{Kubota.2013,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of rehabilitation training with a new wearable robot. DESIGN: Before-after clinical intervention. SETTING: University hospital and private rehabilitation facilities. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of patients (N=38) with limited mobility. The underlying diseases were stroke (n=12), spinal cord injuries (n=8), musculoskeletal diseases (n=4), and other diseases (n=14). INTERVENTIONS: The patients received 90-minute training with a wearable robot twice per week for 8 weeks (16 sessions). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional ambulation was assessed with the 10-m walk test (10MWT) and the Timed Up {\&} Go (TUG) test, and balance ability was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Both assessments were performed at baseline and after rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed 16 sessions of training with the wearable robot. The results of the 10MWT included significant improvements in gait speed, number of steps, and cadence. Although improvements were observed, as measured with the TUG test and BBS, the results were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events were observed during the training. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of rehabilitative training with the wearable robot (16 sessions of 90min) could be performed safely and effectively, even many years after the subjects received their diagnosis.},

@article{Lajeunesse.2016,
 abstract = {PURPOSE: Rehabilitation professionals have little information concerning lower limb exoskeletons for people with paraplegia. This study has four objectives: (1) Outline the characteristics of the exoskeletons' design and their usefulness evidence as assistive mobility devices in the community for the Rewalk, Mina, Indego(R), Ekso (previously known as the eLEGS) and Rex(R); (2) document functional mobility outcomes of using these exoskeletons; (3) document secondary skills and benefits achieved with these exoskeletons, safety, user satisfaction and applicability in the community; and (4) establish level of scientific evidence of the selected studies. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature (January 2004 to April 2014) was done using the databases PubMed, CINAHL and Embase and groups of keywords associated with {\dq}exoskeleton{\dq}, {\dq}lower limb{\dq} and {\dq}paraplegia{\dq}. RESULTS: Seven articles were selected. Exoskeleton use is effective for walking in a laboratory but there are no training protocols to modify identified outcomes over the term usage (ReWalk: 3 months, Mina: 2 months and Indego(R): 1 session). Levels of evidence of selected papers are low. CONCLUSIONS: The applicability and effectiveness of lower limb exoskeletons as assistive devices in the community have not been demonstrated. More research is needed on walking performance with these exoskeletons compared to other mobility devices and other training contexts in the community. Implications for rehabilitation Characteristics of the exoskeletons' design and their usefulness evidence as assistive mobility devices in the community are addressed for the Rewalk, Mina, Indego(R), Ekso and Rex(R) ReWalk, Indego(R) and Mina lower limb exoskeletons are effective for walking in a laboratory for individuals with complete lower-level SCI. The ReWalk has the best results for walking, with a maximum speed of 0.51 m/s after 45 sessions lasting 60 to 120 min; it is comparable to the average speed per day or per week in a manual wheelchair. The level of scientific evidence is low. Other studies are needed to provide more information about performance over the longer term when walking with an exoskeleton, compared to wheelchair mobility, the user's usual locomotion, the use of different exoskeletons or the training context in which the exoskeleton is used.},

@article{Luca.2006,
 abstract = {This report describes an early version of a technique for decomposing surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals into the constituent motor unit (MU) action potential trains. A surface sensor array is used to collect four channels of differentially amplified EMG signals. The decomposition is achieved by a set of algorithms that uses a specially developed knowledge-based Artificial Intelligence framework. In the automatic mode the accuracy ranges from 75 to 91{\%}. An Interactive Editor is used to increase the accuracy to {\textgreater} 97{\%} in signal epochs of about 30-s duration. The accuracy was verified by comparing the firings of action potentials from the EMG signals detected simultaneously by the surface sensor array and by a needle sensor. We have decomposed up to six MU action potential trains from the sEMG signal detected from the orbicularis oculi, platysma, and tibialis anterior muscles. However, the yield is generally low, with typically {\textless} or = 5 MUs per contraction. Both the accuracy and the yield should increase as the algorithms are developed further. With this technique it is possible to investigate the behavior of MUs in muscles that are not easily studied by needle sensors. We found that the inverse relationship between the recruitment threshold and the firing rate previously reported for muscles innervated by spinal nerves is also present in the orbicularis oculi and the platysma, which are innervated by cranial nerves. However, these two muscles were found to have greater and more widespread values of firing rates than those of large limb muscles.},

@article{Murray.2014,
 abstract = {This paper describes a novel controller, intended for use in a lower-limb exoskeleton, to aid gait rehabilitation in patients with hemiparesis after stroke. The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton.},

The technology has over the past 50 years or so moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal. This paper gives an overview of the myoelectric signal processing challenge, a brief look at the challenge from an historical perspective, the state-of-the-art in myoelectric signal processing for prosthesis control, and an indication of where this field is heading. The paper demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in providing clients with useful and reliable myoelectric communication channels, and that exciting work and developments are on the horizon.},

Eight clinical trials were identified and reviewed. For four of these studies, we also pooled short-term mean changes in Fugl-Meyer scores before and after robot-aided therapy. We found that robot-aided therapy of the proximal upper limb improves short- and long-term motor control of the paretic shoulder and elbow in subacute and chronic patients; however, we found no consistent influence on functional abilities.

@article{Stein.2007,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Robot-assisted exercise shows promise as a means of providing exercise therapy for weakness that results from stroke or other neurological conditions. Exoskeletal or {\dq}wearable{\dq} robots can, in principle, provide therapeutic exercise and/or function as powered orthoses to help compensate for chronic weakness. We describe a novel electromyography (EMG)-controlled exoskeletal robotic brace for the elbow (the active joint brace) and the results of a pilot study conducted using this brace for exercise training in individuals with chronic hemiparesis after stroke. DESIGN: Eight stroke survivors with severe chronic hemiparesis were enrolled in this pilot study. One subject withdrew from the study because of scheduling conflicts. A second subject was unable to participate in the training protocol because of insufficient surface EMG activity to control the active joint brace. The six remaining subjects each underwent 18 hrs of exercise training using the device for a period of 6 wks. Outcome measures included the upper-extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer scale and the modified Ashworth scale of muscle hypertonicity. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that the mean upper-extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer scale increased from 15.5 (SD 3.88) to 19 (SD 3.95) (P = 0.04) at the conclusion of training for the six subjects who completed training. Combined (summated) modified Ashworth scale for the elbow flexors and extensors improved from 4.67 (+/-1.2 SD) to 2.33 (+/-0.653 SD) (P = 0.009) and improved for the entire upper limb as well. All subjects tolerated the device, and no complications occurred. CONCLUSION: EMG-controlled powered elbow orthoses can be successfully controlled by severely impaired hemiparetic stroke survivors. This technique shows promise as a new modality for assisted exercise training after stroke.},

 abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of the degree of gait independence achieved by persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) using knee-ankle-foot orthosis with a medial single hip joint (MSH-KAFO). OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the neurological level, degree of paresis, age, and inhibitory physical/other factors on the gait with a MSH-KAFO in patients with SCIs. SETTING: Three university hospitals and two rehabilitation hospitals in Japan. METHODS: The 45 patients (36 men, nine women) examined included 10 with injuries in the cervical cord between C6 and C8 (group C), 20 with injuries in the upper-middle thoracic cord between T4 and T10 (group UT), and 15 with injuries in the lower thoracic-lumbar cord between T12 and L1 (group TL). Mean age was 34.0 years (range 16-68 years). Of these patients, 13 used the Walkabout, four used the gear joint, and 28 used the Primewalk as the medial hip joint. Recursive partitioning, which predicted the final status of gait from the level, degree of paresis, age, and inhibitory factors, was performed, and a decision tree for gait was constructed. Inhibitory factors were spasticity, involuntary spasms or muscle contractions, pain, contracture, weakness of the upper extremities, and decreased motivation to perform gait exercise. The degree of gait independence was rated on the following five-point scale: outdoor independent gait (5 points), indoor independent gait (4 points), indoor supervised gait (3 points), indoor assisted gait (2 points), and gait within parallel bars (1 point). New branches were added to the decision tree for gait based on the clinical experience, thereby constructing a new decision tree. RESULTS: The coincident ratio between the value predicted on the basis of the decision tree of gait and the value actually observed was 53.3{\%}. The coincident ratio between the value predicted on the basis of the modified decision tree of gait and the actually observed value was 68.9{\%}. CONCLUSION: The results provide valuable information to medical teams that may assist prescription of gait orthoses.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the immediate effect of a portable, myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis on paretic upper extremity (UE) impairment in chronic, stable, moderately impaired stroke survivors. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants exhibiting chronic, moderate, stable, poststroke, UE hemiparesis (N=18). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were administered a battery of measures testing UE impairment and function. They then donned a fabricated myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis and were again tested on the same battery of measures while wearing the device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the UE Section of the Fugl-Meyer Scale. Subjects were also administered a battery of functional tasks and the Box and Block (BB) test. RESULTS: Subjects exhibited significantly reduced UE impairment while wearing the myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis (FM: t17=8.56, P{\textless}.0001) and increased quality in performing all functional tasks while wearing the myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis, with 3 subtasks showing significant increases (feeding [grasp]: z=2.251, P=.024; feeding [elbow]: z=2.966, P=.003; drinking [grasp]: z=3.187, P=.001). Additionally, subjects showed significant decreases in time taken to grasp a cup (z=1.286, P=.016) and increased gross manual dexterity while wearing a myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis (BB test: z=3.42, P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that UE impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Scale, is significantly reduced when donning a myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis, and these changes exceeded the Fugl-Meyer Scale's clinically important difference threshold. Further, utilization of a myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis significantly increased gross manual dexterity and performance of certain functional tasks. Future work will integrate education sessions to increase subjects' ability to perform multijoint functional movements and attain consistent functional changes.},

 abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Postintervention. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of the Praxis multifunctional implantable functional electrical stimulation (FES) system (Neopraxis Pty. Ltd, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) to provide standing and stepping ability and bladder and bowel management for individuals with motor complete thoracic level spinal cord injuries (SCI). SETTING: Pediatric orthopedic hospital specializing in SCI. SUBJECTS: Three males, ages 17 and 21 years, with motor-complete thoracic level SCI and intact lower motor neurons to the muscles targeted for stimulation. METHODS: Each subject was successfully implanted with the Praxis FES system. All three subjects received electrodes for upright mobility and the first two subjects received additional electrodes for stimulated bladder and bowel management. Following training, subjects were evaluated in their ability to use FES for nine mobility activities. Acute and chronic experiments of the effect of stimulation on bowel and bladder function were also performed. RESULTS: All three subjects could independently stand up from the wheelchair and could walk at least 6 m using a swing through gait pattern. Two subjects were able to independently perform swing through gait for 6 min and one subject was able to independently ascend and descend stairs. Suppression of reflex bladder contractions by neuromodulation (subject 1) and stimulated contractions of the rectum (subject 2) were observed in acute experiments. When stimulation was applied over the course of several weeks, a positive effect on bowel function was measured. Stimulated bladder contractions were not achieved. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of using the Praxis FES system for upright mobility and aiding aspects of bladder and bowel function was demonstrated with three subjects with thoracic level SCI.},

@article{Aach.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile exoskeletons are increasingly being applied in the course of rehabilitation and provision of medical aids to patients with spinal cord injuries. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This article gives a description of the currently available exoskeletal systems and the clinical application including scientific and medical evidence, to derive recommendations regarding clinical practice of the various exoskeletons in the rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries. RESULTS: The different systems represent a useful adjunct to the therapeutic regimen depending on the medical objectives. Posture-controlled exoskeletons in particular enable mobilization of patients with neurological gait disorders via direct motion support. In addition the neurologically controlled exoskeleton HAL(R) leads to functional improvements in patients with residual muscular functions in the chronic phase of spinal cord injury in terms of improved walking abilities subsequent to training. However, beneficial effects on bone density, bladder function and perfusion are conceivable but not yet adequately supported by evidence. Positive effects on spasticity and neuropathic pain are currently based only on case series or small clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Although exoskeletons are not yet an established tool in the treatment of spinal cord injuries, the systems will play a more important role in rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries in the future. Neurologically controlled exoskeletons show beneficial effects in the treatment of acute and chronic spinal cord injuries and might therefore evolve to be a useful alternative to conventional locomotion training.},

However this statically balanced gait presents important differences with the dynamically balanced gait of human subjects.

@article{Bhambhani.2000,
 abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing healthy subjects with age and gender matched subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI, injury levels from C5 to T12). OBJECTIVES: To compare the acute cardiorespiratory responses and muscle oxygenation trends during functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycle exercise and recovery in the SCI and healthy subjects exercising on a mechanical cycle ergometer. SETTING: Seven volunteers in each group participated in one exercise test at the Rick Hansen Center, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. METHODS: Both groups completed a stagewise incremental test to voluntary fatigue followed by 2 min each of active and passive recovery. Cardiorespiratory responses were continuously monitored using an automated metabolic cart and a wireless heart rate monitor. Tissue absorbency, an index of muscle oxygenation, was monitored non-invasively from the vastus lateralis using near infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: The healthy subjects showed significant (P{\textless}0.05) increases in the oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR) and ventilation rate (VE) from rest to maximal exercise. The SCI subjects showed a twofold increase in VO2 (P{\textgreater}0.05), a threefold increase in VE (P{\textless}0.05) and a 5 beats/min increase in HR (P{\textgreater}0.05) from the resting value. The SCI subjects demonstrated a lesser degree (P{\textless}0.05) of muscle deoxygenation than the healthy subjects during the transition from rest to exercise. Regression analysis indicated that the rate of decline in muscle deoxygenation with respect to the VO2 was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) faster in the SCI subjects compared to healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: FES exercise in SCI subjects elicits: (a) modest increases in the cardiorespiratory responses when compared to resting levels; (b) lower degree of muscle deoxygenation during maximal exercise, and (c) faster changes in muscle deoxygenation with respect to the VO2 during exercise when compared to healthy subjects.},

@article{Bishop.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditional physical therapy is beneficial in restoring mobility in individuals who have sustained spinal cord injury (SCI), but residual limitations often persist. Robotic technologies may offer opportunities for further gains. The purpose of this case study was to document the use and practicality of gait training for an individual with chronic, incomplete SCI with asymmetric lower limb motor deficits using a novel robotic knee orthosis (RKO). CASE DESCRIPTION: The participant was a 22-year-old woman who sustained fractures of the odontoid process and C5-C6 vertebrae from a motor vehicle accident resulting in incomplete SCI with asymmetric tetraparesis, right side more severe than left side. She required supervised assistance with gait and balance tasks, minimal assistance to ascend/descend steps using a handrail, and upper extremity assistance for sit-to-stand tasks. INTERVENTION: The participant underwent 7 one-hour sessions of mobility training, using a novel RKO. Her primary goal was to increase independence and endurance with mobility. OUTCOMES: Functional measures included the 6-Minute Walk Test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up {\&} Go Test, and the 10-Meter Walk Test. Outcomes were assessed and recorded at baseline and on completion of 7 hours of training with the device over a 2-week period. No adverse events occurred. The RKO was well received by both the participant and the treating therapist. The participant demonstrated improvements in the 6-Minute Walk Test and Berg Balance Scale after RKO-training intervention. DISCUSSION: Outcomes suggest that the use of this device during a physical therapy program for an individual with incomplete SCI is practical and this device may be a useful adjunct to standard training.},

One artificial pneumatic muscle provided plantar flexion torque and the second one provided dorsiflexion torque. Computer software adjusted air pressure in each artificial muscle independently so that artificial muscle force was proportional to rectified low-pass-filtered electromyography (EMG) amplitude (i.e., proportional myoelectric control). Tibialis anterior EMG activated the artificial dorsiflexor and soleus EMG activated the artificial plantar flexor. We collected joint kinematic and artificial muscle force data as one healthy participant walked on a treadmill with the orthosis. Peak plantar flexor torque provided by the orthosis was 70 Nm, and peak dorsiflexor torque provided by the orthosis was 38 Nm. The orthosis could be useful for basic science studies on human locomotion or possibly for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury.},

 abstract = {The recent introduction of novel multifunction hands as well as new control paradigms increase the demand for advanced prosthetic control systems. In this context, an unambiguous terminology and a good understanding of the nature of the control problem is important for efficient research and communication concerning the subject. Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

@article{Frotzler.2009,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate adaptive changes in bone and muscle parameters in the paralysed limbs after detraining or reduced functional electrical stimulation (FES) induced cycling following high-volume FES-cycling in chronic spinal cord injury. SUBJECTS: Five subjects with motor-sensory complete spinal cord injury (age 38.6 years, lesion duration 11.4 years) were included. Four subjects stopped FES-cycling completely after the training phase whereas one continued reduced FES-cycling (2-3 times/week, for 30 min). METHODS: Bone and muscle parameters were assessed in the legs using peripheral quantitative computed tomography at 6 and 12 months after cessation of high-volume FES-cycling. RESULTS: Gains achieved in the distal femur by high-volume FES-cycling were partly maintained at one year of detraining: 73.0{\%} in trabecular bone mineral density, 63.8{\%} in total bone mineral density, 59.4{\%} in bone mineral content and 22.1{\%} in muscle cross-sectional area in the thigh. The subject who continued reduced FES-cycling maintained 96.2{\%} and 95.0{\%} of the previous gain in total and trabecular bone mineral density, and 98.5{\%} in muscle cross-sectional area. CONCLUSION: Bone and muscle benefits achieved by one year of high-volume FES-cycling are partly preserved after 12 months of detraining, whereas reduced cycling maintains bone and muscle mass gained. This suggests that high-volume FES-cycling has clinical relevance for at least one year after detraining.},

 abstract = {We used a lower limb robotic exoskeleton controlled by the wearer's muscle activity to study human locomotor adaptation to disrupted muscular coordination. Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects' gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by approximately 35{\%} and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loss of legged mobility due to spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with multiple physiological and psychological impacts. Powered exoskeletons offer the possibility of regained mobility and reversal or prevention of the secondary effects associated with immobility. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate mobility outcomes for individuals with SCI after 5 gait-training sessions with a powered exoskeleton, with a primary goal of characterizing the ease of learning and usability of the system. METHODS: Sixteen subjects with SCI were enrolled in a pilot clinical trial at Shepherd Center, Atlanta, Georgia, with injury levels ranging from C5 complete to L1 incomplete. An investigational Indego exoskeleton research kit was evaluated for ease of use and efficacy in providing legged mobility. Outcome measures of the study included the 10-meter walk test (10 MWT) and the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) as well as measures of independence including donning and doffing times and the ability to walk on various surfaces. RESULTS: At the end of 5 sessions (1.5 hours per session), average walking speed was 0.22 m/s for persons with C5-6 motor complete tetraplegia, 0.26 m/s for T1-8 motor complete paraplegia, and 0.45 m/s for T9-L1 paraplegia. Distances covered in 6 minutes averaged 64 meters for those with C5-6, 74 meters for T1-8, and 121 meters for T9-L1. Additionally, all participants were able to walk on both indoor and outdoor surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: Results after only 5 sessions suggest that persons with tetraplegia and paraplegia learn to use the Indego exoskeleton quickly and can manage a variety of surfaces. Walking speeds and distances achieved also indicate that some individuals with paraplegia can quickly become limited community ambulators using this system.},

@article{Hesse.2003,
 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The successful motor rehabilitation of stroke, traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients requires an intensive and task-specific therapy approach. Budget constraints limit a hand-to-hand therapy approach, so that intelligent machines may offer a solution to promote motor recovery and obtain a better understanding of motor control. This new field of automated or robot-assisted motor rehabilitation has emerged since the 1990s. RECENT FINDINGS: This article will present clinically viable devices for upper and lower extremity rehabilitation. The MIT-Manus and the Mirror-Image Motion Enabler robot, which enable unrestricted unilateral or bilateral shoulder and elbow movement, consistently proved superior on the motor impairment level. The ARM guide, which assisted reaching in a straight-line trajectory, and the Bi-Manu-Track, which enabled the bilateral practice of a forearm and wrist movement, are currently being tested. For gait rehabilitation after stroke, the electromechanical gait trainer, GT I, has proved effective compared with treadmill training with body weight support. The Lokomat, consisting of a treadmill and a powered exoskeleton, lessened the therapeutic effort compared with manually assisted treadmill training in spinal cord-injured patients. Future developments will see more degrees of freedom, improved man-machine interaction and the implementation of virtual reality. SUMMARY: Technical possibilities are one aspect, but multi-centre trials and a consideration of the unsubstantiated fears among therapists of being replaced by machines will decide on the successful implementation of this most promising field to the benefit of patients.},

@article{Englehart.2003,
 abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

@article{Zeilig.2012,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of use of the ReWalk exoskeleton ambulation system in people with spinal cord injury. Measures of functional ambulation were also assessed and correlated to neurological spinal cord level, age, and duration since injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case series observational study. SETTING: A national spinal cord injury centre. METHODS: Six volunteer participants were recruited from the follow-up outpatient clinic. Safety was assessed with regard to falls, status of the skin, status of the spine and joints, blood pressure, pulse, and electrocardiography (ECG). Pain and fatigue were graded by the participants using a visual analogue scale pre- and post-training. Participants completed a 10-statement questionnaire regarding safety, comfort, and secondary medical effects. After being able to walk 100 m, timed up and go, distance walked in 6 minutes and 10-m timed walk were measured. RESULTS: There were no adverse safety events. Use of the system was generally well tolerated, with no increase in pain and a moderate level of fatigue after use. Individuals with lower level of spinal cord injury performed walking more efficiently. CONCLUSION: Volunteer participants were able to ambulate with the ReWalk for a distance of 100 m, with no adverse effects during the course of an average of 13-14 training sessions. The participants were generally positive regarding the use of the system.},
